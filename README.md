Support
-------
Supports web catalogues of different library system vendors, see our [website](http://de.opacapp.net/kompatibilitaet/) or [wiki](https://github.com/raphaelm/opacclient/wiki/Supported-library-types) for details.

Java Library (`libopac`)
------------------------
The underlying code that the app uses to connect to the different supported OPAC software systems and parse 
data from them is available as a separate library called `libopac`. It can also be used in ordinary Java 
projects because it does not depend on Android APIs. More information about the library can be found in 
[its own README file](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/libopac/README.md).

Contributing
------------
We'd like to invite you to contribute to our project, e.g. by improving the user interface or adding support
for new libraries. Checking out the project with Android Studio should be fairly straightforward, but we
also got a little bit of information in the [project wiki](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/wiki).
Contributions are best submitted via GitHub pull requests.

If you get stuck anywhere in the process, please do not hestitate to ask us anytime at info@opacapp.de.
